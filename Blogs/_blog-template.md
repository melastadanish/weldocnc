- H1: [Post Title]
- Meta bar: [Author] · [Date] · [Reading time]

## Article Body
**Design:** Single column, max-width 72ch (approx 700px). Left column on desktop with TOC sidebar right. Full-width on mobile.

**Typography:**
- Body: 17–18px, 1.7 line-height, generous paragraph spacing
- H2: Clear visual hierarchy — section breaks
- H3: Sub-section within H2
- Bold: Key terms and callouts only — not decorative
- No italics for emphasis — use bold sparingly instead

**Content guidelines:**
- Open with the problem or question — not "In this article we will explore..."
- H2 sections answer the question directly — no buried lede
- Use tables for comparisons and specifications — engineers scan
- Use numbered lists for processes and sequences; bullet lists for non-ordered information
- Include specific numbers, tolerances, and material properties — not vague claims
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly — this is what engineers trust
- Write as: technical writer, mechanical engineering background, 20yr CNC industry experience
